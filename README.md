**What is the Bitcoin predection?**

Bitcoin price prediction is a challenging task due to its extreme volatility and complex market dynamics. It involves analyzing historical data, market sentiment, and fundamental factors to make forecasts. Various methods, including technical analysis, machine learning models, and sentiment analysis, are employed. Predictions should be approached with caution, as the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, and unexpected events can lead to sudden price fluctuations. Diversification and risk management are crucial for anyone considering Bitcoin investments.

**Importance of Stock Market**

1. **Investment Strategy**: Accurate Bitcoin predictions help investors make informed decisions, such as when to buy or sell, which is crucial for optimizing returns and managing risk.

2. **Risk Management**: Predictive models provide insights into potential price fluctuations, allowing traders and investors to implement risk management strategies and protect their capital.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Bitcoin price predictions reflect market sentiment and can influence investor confidence. Positive predictions may encourage more buying, while negative forecasts may trigger selling.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Predictions can assist regulatory bodies in monitoring and regulating the cryptocurrency market, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and preventing fraud.

5. **Economic Impact**: Bitcoin's price often correlates with macroeconomic events. Accurate predictions help governments and policymakers understand its impact on the broader economy and financial stability.
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® OneDAL toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneDALtoolkit/overview.html),[Intel® Data preprocessing toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/Data-preprocessing/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. Deep learning algorithm is used and RNN function is used.




<h2>PLATFORMS</h2>


**CODES IN DIFFERENT PLATFORMS:**

It tooks nearly 48seconds to 58 seconds to run single keras model files in Jupyter n0tebook
But in OPENVINO it took 135 milliseconds to 141 milliseconds to run it where this keras model consist of 100 files to run it and make to fit for the model.

<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<li>The model was trained using Google's stock market data(Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) to enhance its technical proficiency.
</li>
<li>  The keras model helps to create a model, layer by layer. The dense layer is fully connected layer, so all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in a next layer by using tensorflow as a backend.</li>

**LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY NETWORK:**
 LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies.
It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.
