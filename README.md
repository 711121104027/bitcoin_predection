**What is the Bitcoin predection?**

Bitcoin price prediction is a challenging task due to its extreme volatility and complex market dynamics. It involves analyzing historical data, market sentiment, and fundamental factors to make forecasts. Various methods, including technical analysis, machine learning models, and sentiment analysis, are employed. Predictions should be approached with caution, as the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, and unexpected events can lead to sudden price fluctuations. Diversification and risk management are crucial for anyone considering Bitcoin investments.

**Importance of Stock Market**

1. **Investment Strategy**: Accurate Bitcoin predictions help investors make informed decisions, such as when to buy or sell, which is crucial for optimizing returns and managing risk.

2. **Risk Management**: Predictive models provide insights into potential price fluctuations, allowing traders and investors to implement risk management strategies and protect their capital.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Bitcoin price predictions reflect market sentiment and can influence investor confidence. Positive predictions may encourage more buying, while negative forecasts may trigger selling.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Predictions can assist regulatory bodies in monitoring and regulating the cryptocurrency market, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and preventing fraud.

5. **Economic Impact**: Bitcoin's price often correlates with macroeconomic events. Accurate predictions help governments and policymakers understand its impact on the broader economy and financial stability.
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® OneDAL toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneDALtoolkit/overview.html),[Intel® Data preprocessing toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/Data-preprocessing/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. Deep learning algorithm is used and RNN function is used.




<h2>PLATFORMS</h2>


**CODES IN DIFFERENT PLATFORMS:**

It tooks nearly 40 seconds to 45 seconds to run single keras model files in Jupyter n0tebook
But in OneDAL it took 100 milliseconds to 115 milliseconds to run it where this keras model consist of 100 files in one epoch to run it and make to fit for the model.

<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
1.Accurate predictions depend on the quality of data used for analysis. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to erroneous predictions. Therefore, ensuring data accuracy and precision is critical in cryptocurrency analysis.
2.When building predictive models for Bitcoin price, it's essential to evaluate their performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics measure the accuracy and precision of a model's predictions.
3.Historical price data serves as the foundation for predictive models. Ensuring that historical price records are accurate and precise is vital for reliable analysis and forecasting.
4.Assessing market sentiment through sentiment analysis tools and natural language processing can add depth to predictions. The accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms impacts the precision of sentiment-based predictions.
5.Predictive models often provide confidence intervals around their forecasts. These intervals express the precision of the prediction and the level of confidence in the outcome.

**LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY NETWORK:**
 LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies.
It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.
